# WEB site with a voice acting of interactive elements.

### What is it?

 It's my first demo project of WEB site for blind and  visually impaired people.

### What did I do?

 I made a voice acting of WEB elements such as buttons, links, descriptions, things who have
a text.

### Why did I do?

 I want to take care of people who can't see or can't see well.
A lot of them usually use a screen readers, I know. But it means, they only hear voice of robots.
It hasn't got any intonation and its speech sounds unnatural.
I decided to make something different. In my view, voice of professial actor sounds better
than typical voice of screen reader. 
So I recorder my voice and made this demo page.

### How it works?

Users will hear audio track when they push the TAB button for navigation on page. Also when they push the ENTER
for choose something.
