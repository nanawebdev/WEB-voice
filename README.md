# Website with a voice acting of interactive elements.

### What is it?

 It's my first demo project of WEB site for blind and visually impaired people.

### What did I do?

I made a voice acting of web elements such as buttons, links, descriptions, things which have a text.

### Why did I do?

I want to take care of people who can't see or can't see well.
A lot of them usually use a screen reader, I know. But it means, they only hear voice of robots.
It hasn't got any intonation, and its speech sounds unnatural.
I decided to make something different. In my view, voice of professional actor sounds better than typical voice of screen reader.
So I recorder my voice and made this demo page.

### How does it work?

Users will hear audio track when they push the TAB button for navigation on the page. Also when they press the ENTER to choose something.
